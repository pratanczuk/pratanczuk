### Software Development Processes and Formal Requirements ‚ú®
I specialize in optimizing Software Development Processes to enhance team efficiency and product quality. With extensive experience in Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban, I implement best practices that streamline development workflows and foster collaborative environments.

I am well-versed in industry standards such as Automotive SPICE, CMMI (Capability Maturity Model Integration), and FDA 21 CFR Part 11 regulations. My familiarity with these frameworks and regulations enables me to ensure compliance and maintain high-quality standards in highly regulated industries like automotive and healthcare.

My expertise in Formal Requirements involves precise specification and rigorous documentation techniques. By utilizing modeling languages such as UML and engaging in thorough requirements engineering, I ensure that complex user needs are translated into clear, actionable, and testable specifications. This focus helps bridge the gap between business objectives and technical implementation, resulting in software solutions that meet or exceed client expectations.

I'm passionate about continuous improvement and am committed to leveraging industry standards to optimize the entire software development lifecycle.
